1. Create a function that takes in a cost and a quantity and outputs the
total pre-tax cost for that quantity of items at the given price. For
example

var preTaxTotal = totalCost(5, 5.99); // 5 items at 5.99
//=> 29.950000000000003

2. [ a function that calls a function ]

3. Write a function that takes a rank and a suit as input, and returns a
string representation of a card. For example if we call

console.log(cardString("ace", "spades"));
//=> ace of spades

console.log(cardString("queen", "hearts"));
//=> queen of hearts

4. Use the previous function to print out a few cards with various suits
and ranks.

5. Write a function that converts a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit,
and vice-versa. To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you multiply
the celsius value by 9 and then divide by 5. Then you add 32. To
convert the other way, you subtract 32, and then multiply by
9. Finally, you divide by 5. The division operator in JavaScript is
`/`.

6. We described a function called `addThree` that accepts three
numbers and returns their sum. What happens when you call that
function with strings instead of numbers? What happens if some of the
values are numbers and some are strings? Try various approaches and
explain what is happening.
