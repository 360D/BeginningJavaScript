1. Write a function called `sumFirstNNumbers` so that it accepts a parameter `n`
and sums the first `n` positive integers. For example, if you call
`sumFirstNNumbers(5)` it should sum the numbers 1 through 5 inclusive.

2. Write a function called `sumAToB` so that it accepts two parameters `begin` and
`end` and sums the numbers between `begin` and `end` inclusive. What would you change if
you didn't want the sum to include `b`? What would you change if you didn't want
the sum to include `a`?

3. A number is a prime number if it is only evenly divisible by 1 and itself
(although we don't consider 1 a prime number, so 2 is the first prime
number). Write a function called `isPrime` that accepts a number `p` as an
argument and returns `true` if it is prime, `false` otherwise.

4. Using the `isPrime` function, write a function that sums all the primes
smaller than 100.

5. Using the `isPrime` function, write a function that sums the first 100 prime
numbers.
